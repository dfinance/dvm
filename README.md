## Installation

There are two ways to install and try DVM - [with Docker](#the-docker-way) or [with Rust-toolchain](#installation-with-rust--cargo).


### The Docker way

You can use this schema for your docker-compose to run everything at once:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  dvm-compiler:
    container_name: dvm-compiler
    image: dfinance/dvm
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    command: ./compiler "http://0.0.0.0:50053" "http://127.0.0.1:50052"
  dvm-server:
    container_name: dvm-server
    image: dfinance/dvm
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    command: ./dvm "http://0.0.0.0:50051" "http://127.0.0.1:50052"
```

Or you can pull container from docker hub and run it by yourself:

```bash
# pull the latest containers
docker pull dfinance/dvm
```

That is how you do it:

```bash
# run compiler
docker run -d --rm --network host --name compiler -p 50053:50053 registry.wings.toys/dfinance/dvm:master ./compiler "http://0.0.0.0:50053" "http://127.0.0.1:50052"

# run virtual machine
docker run -d --rm --network host --name dvm -p 50051:50051 registry.wings.toys/dfinance/dvm:master ./dvm "http://0.0.0.0:50051" "http://127.0.0.1:50052"
```

```bash
# stop compiler and vm
docker stop compiler
docker stop dvm
```

### Installation with Rust ðŸ¦€ Cargo

<!-- TODO: type here something -->


### Prerequisites

- install [Rust][], the easiest way to get it is to use [Rustup][]
- install [protoc][]

[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org
[Rustup]: https://rustup.rs
[protoc]: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases


### Build and Install

To install using `cargo` run the following command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dfinance/dvm.git
```

As result you will get the following executables into your `.cargo/bin` directory:

- `dvm` - virtual machine server
- `compiler` - compilation server
- `stdlib-builder` - standard library builder (useful for genesis creation)

Uninstallation: `cargo uninstall dvm`.


## Usage

> Note: Following instructions are for standalone binary executables. If you want to use `cargo` to build & run, just add `cargo run --bin ` at the start of the mentioned command.


### DVM server

`dvm` is a Move/Mvir virtual machine gRPC server.
API described in [protobuf schemas][].

To launch the DVM server use this command:

```bash
# format: <which host:port to listen> <data-source address>
dvm "http://[::1]:50051" "http://[::1]:50052"
```


### Compilation server

`compiler` is a Move compilation gRPC server.
API described in [protobuf schemas][].

To launch the compilation server run:

```bash
# format: <which host:port to listen> <data-source address>
compiler "http://[::1]:50053" "http://[::1]:50052"
```

> Compiler supports Move lang.

[protobuf schemas]: https://github.com/dfinance/dvm-proto/tree/master/protos


### Stdlib Builder

`stdlib-builder` is a standard library builder.

To build standard library run:

```bash
# format:   <source directory> [-o output-file] [--verbose] [-p] [--help]`
# print output to stdout:
stdlib-builder lang/stdlib -p
# or write output to the file:
stdlib-builder lang/stdlib -po ./stdlib.json
```

To build your stdlib run:

```bash
stdlib-builder /path-to-your/std-lib -po ./stdlib.json
```


### Configuration actual for both

#### Positional arguments:

__DVM__ and __compiler__ both require positional argument described as `<data-source address>`.
This is URI of a data source server, typically [Dnode][], local or external.
This argument can be ommited because we'll read the `DVM_DATA_SOURCE` [environment variable][environment variables] as fallback.

All of this URIs are supports following schemes:

- `http`
- `ipc` (using [UDS][]), e.g.:
    - `ipc://tmp/dir/file` (absolute path)
    - `ipc://./dir/file` (relative path with `.` and `..`)
    - `ipc://~/dir/file` (relative to `$HOME`)

Positional arguments have higher priority than [environment variables][], and override them when specified.

For example:

```bash
# using env var:
DVM_DATA_SOURCE="http://[::1]:50052" dvm "http://[::1]:50051"
# or using positional arg:
dvm "http://[::1]:50051" "http://[::1]:50052"
# both is same
```

But env vars used just as fallback, so args are higher prioritised.
```bash
DVM_DATA_SOURCE="http://[::1]:42" dvm "http://[::1]:50051" "http://[::1]:50052"
# There DVM will listen port 50051
# and connect to data source on 50052 port
# ignoring env variable.
```

[Dnode]: https://github.com/dfinance/dnode
[UDS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket


#### Environment variables:

- `DVM_DATA_SOURCE` - Data-source address.
  Used if relevant positional argument isn't specified.
- `DVM_LOG` - Log filters. The same as standard `RUST_LOG` environment variable.
  Possible values in verbosity ordering: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` and `trace`.
  For complex filters see [documentation](https://docs.rs/env_logger/#filtering-results)
- `DVM_LOG_STYLE` - Log colors. The same as standard `RUST_LOG_STYLE`.
  Possible values in verbosity ordering: `auto`, `always`, `never`.
- `DVM_SENTRY_DSN` - Optional key-uri, enables crash logging service integration.
  If value ommited, crash logging service will not be initialized.
  E.g.: `DVM_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@uri dvm "http://[::1]:50051"`
- `DVM_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` - Sets the environment code to separate events from testnet and production.
  Optional. Works with Sentry integration.
  E.g.: `DVM_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT="testnet"`


### Optional arguments:

Optional arguments have higher priority than [environment variables][], and override them when specified.

- `--log` - same as `DVM_LOG`
- `--log-color` - same as `DVM_LOG_STYLE`
- `--sentry-dsn` - same as `DVM_SENTRY_DSN`
- `--sentry-env` - same as `DVM_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`

[environment variables]: #environment-variables

For more info run dvm or compiler with `--help`.
